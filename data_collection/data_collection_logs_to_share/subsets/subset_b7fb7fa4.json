It's true that AUC is often used to evaluate classification models, but it can be misleading with imbalanced datasets.\n\nBefore we dive into *why* it's unreliable, let's make sure we're on the same page. Can you explain in your own words what the ROC curve and AUC actually represent? What are we plotting, and what does the AUC value tell us in general terms?",
