Before we dive into when a semaphore is *preferred*, let's make sure we're on the same page.\n\nCan you briefly explain, in your own words, what a mutex is used for, and what a semaphore is used for? What are the key differences you understand between them?",

Now, let's dig a bit deeper.\n\nYour analogy highlights the counting aspect of semaphores versus the exclusive access aspect of mutexes.\n\nGiven that, can you think of a situation where you would need to control access to a resource, but allowing more than one process to access it *simultaneously* (up to a certain limit) is acceptable or even desirable? How might a semaphore be useful in that scenario, and why would a mutex be insufficient?",
