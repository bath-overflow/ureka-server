Now, let's think about what happens when multiple cores are all trying to acquire the same spinlock *at the same time* (high contention).\n\nWhat do you think each core is doing while it's waiting for the lock to become available? And what implications might that have for the other cores and the overall system?",

What are the *specific* consequences of all those cores constantly spinning and checking the lock variable? Think about things like:\n\n*   **Cache coherence:** What happens to the cache lines associated with the lock variable when multiple cores are repeatedly reading and potentially writing to it?\n*   **Resource utilization:** How are the CPU cores being utilized when they are spinning?\n*   **Fairness:** Is there any guarantee that threads will acquire the lock in any particular order?\n\nConsider these points, and tell me what you think.",
