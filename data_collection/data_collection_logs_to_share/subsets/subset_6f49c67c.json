You said regularization *sometimes* fails despite \"theoretical guarantees.\"\n\nFirst, let's make sure we're on the same page. When you say \"theoretical guarantees,\" what specific guarantees are you thinking of? Can you give me an example of a theoretical result about regularization that you have in mind? This will help us understand the limitations better.",
