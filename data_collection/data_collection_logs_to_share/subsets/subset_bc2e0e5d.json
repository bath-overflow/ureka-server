Can you remind me what internal fragmentation *is* in the context of memory management? Don't worry about being perfectly precise, just give me your understanding of the concept.",

If you increase the page size, what happens to the *potential* amount of wasted space within a single page? Think about it in terms of extremes: a 1KB page versus a 1MB page.
