So, if every process gets an equal slice, let's explore that a bit further.\n\nImagine you have two processes:\n\n*   Process A: A CPU-intensive task, like video encoding, that needs a lot of processing power.\n*   Process B: An interactive application, like a text editor, that spends most of its time waiting for user input.\n\nIf you give each process an equal slice of CPU time, what might be the *user experience* like for Process B? Would it *feel* fair to the user interacting with the text editor? Why or why not?",

Even though Process B is *getting* its \"fair\" share of CPU time, it's not *using* it effectively.\n\nNow, let's dig a little deeper into why that \"sluggishness\" matters. What's the difference between how Process A (video encoding) and Process B (text editor) *perceive* time? Think about the scale at which they operate. How quickly does a user expect a text editor to respond compared to how quickly they expect a video to finish encoding? This difference in time scale is crucial to understanding what \"fairness\" really means to the user.",
