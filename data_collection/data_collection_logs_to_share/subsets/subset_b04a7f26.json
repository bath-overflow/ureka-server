To really understand how copy-on-write (COW) improves `fork()`, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, can you remind me what the traditional `fork()` system call *used* to do (before COW was widely adopted)? What was the main performance bottleneck? Think about what resources need to be duplicated.",

It's important to be precise about what gets duplicated.\n\nSo, before COW, when `fork()` was called, do you think the *kernel* data structures (like process control blocks, file descriptors, etc.) were duplicated, or were they handled differently? And, *why* do you think that? Consider what the kernel needs to do to manage the new process.",
