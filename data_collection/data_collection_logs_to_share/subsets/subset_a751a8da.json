It gets to the heart of understanding the nuances between these two self-balancing tree structures.\n\nBefore diving into specific scenarios, let's make sure we're on the same page about their fundamental differences. Can you briefly describe the core principle behind how AVL trees and Red-Black trees maintain their balance? What makes an AVL tree an AVL tree, and what defines a Red-Black tree?",
