      "message": "Excellent! You've nailed the core idea. Dijkstra's is a greedy algorithm, meaning it makes the locally optimal choice at each step, assuming that this will lead to the globally optimal solution.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens when we introduce negative-weight edges. Can you imagine a scenario where Dijkstra's might make a wrong decision because of a negative edge? Perhaps walk me through a simple example graph where adding a negative edge *after* Dijkstra's has \"settled\" on a path to a node would change the shortest path. Draw it out if you need to! This will help us understand the core problem.",

Now, what if there's a negative edge of -4 from B to C? Would Dijkstra's still think the shortest path to C is 5, even though going through B would give us 2 - 4 = -2?",

      "message": "Precisely! You've hit the nail on the head. Dijkstra's, having already \"settled\" on the path from A to C with a cost of 5, considers C \"visited\" and doesn't revisit it. It trusts that the shortest path to C has been found. But the negative edge from B to C creates a shorter path that Dijkstra's misses.\n\nSo, the core problem is that Dijkstra's algorithm's greedy approach isn't valid when negative edges are present. It assumes that once a node is visited, its shortest path is known, which isn't true with negative edges.\n\nNow, with that understanding of *why* Dijkstra's fails, let's shift our focus to the Bellman-Ford algorithm. What is Bellman-Ford's general strategy for finding shortest paths? How does it differ from Dijkstra's fundamental approach, and how might that difference allow it to handle negative edges?",
