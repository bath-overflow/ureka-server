      "message": "Exactly! You've got the core idea. The gradients are supposed to guide the weights towards better values, but if they're too large, they cause the weights to take huge, erratic steps. This prevents the network from converging on a good solution. It's like trying to steer a car by jerking the wheel back and forth wildly â€“ you'll never reach your destination.\n\nNow, let's switch gears. What about vanishing gradients? What does it mean for a gradient to \"vanish,\" and what problems does *that* cause?",
