Can you remind me what internal fragmentation *is* in the context of memory management? In your own words, how would you describe it?",

Now, let's connect that to page size.\n\nThink about it this way: if you have a larger page size, what does that imply about the *smallest* amount of memory that can be allocated to a process? And how might that relate to the potential for wasted space within that allocation?",
