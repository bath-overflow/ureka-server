      "message": "Excellent! You've hit on the crucial point. Randomized pivots don't *eliminate* the possibility of O(n^2) time, they just make it extremely *unlikely*.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n*   **Non-randomized Quicksort (with a bad pivot choice):** It's like always picking the *shortest* person in a group to lead a parade. If the group is already sorted by height, you'll consistently pick the shortest, leading to a very inefficient parade formation. It's almost guaranteed to be bad.\n\n*   **Randomized Quicksort:** Now, imagine picking a random person to lead the parade each time. You *could* still pick the shortest person, but the odds are much lower, especially in a large group. Most of the time, you'll pick someone closer to the average height, leading to a more balanced parade formation.\n\nSo, given this analogy, let's consider a few questions:\n\n1.  Can you think of a scenario, even with a randomized pivot, where you *might* still consistently get unlucky and end up with near-worst-case performance? (Hint: think about probability and repeated events)\n\n2.  If O(n^2) is still *possible*, why is randomized quicksort still considered a very practical and widely used algorithm? What makes it so appealing despite this potential downside?",
