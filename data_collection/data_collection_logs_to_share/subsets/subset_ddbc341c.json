Internal fragmentation *is* the wasted space within a page because a process doesn't perfectly fill it.\n\nNow, let's build on that. Think about this: if you have a *larger* page size, what happens to the *potential* amount of unused space within that single page? Does it increase, decrease, or stay the same? Why?",
