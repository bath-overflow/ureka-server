It shows you're thinking critically about the Master Theorem.\n\nBefore we dive into *why* it's inapplicable to something like T(n) = 2T(√n) + log n, let's make sure we're on the same page. Can you remind me of the general form of a recurrence relation that the Master Theorem *can* be applied to? What does it look like?",
