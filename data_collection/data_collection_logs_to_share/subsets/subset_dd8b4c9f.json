Before we dive into specific scenarios, let's make sure we're on the same page regarding the core difference between AVL and Red-Black trees.\n\nIn your own words, can you briefly describe the main characteristic that distinguishes an AVL tree from a Red-Black tree in terms of their balance? What does each tree prioritize in its balancing act?",
