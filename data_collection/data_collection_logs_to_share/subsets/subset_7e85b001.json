It gets right to the heart of understanding the nuances between AVL and Red-Black trees.\n\nInstead of just giving you the answer, let's explore this together. To start, can you tell me what you already know about AVL trees and Red-Black trees? What are their key characteristics, in terms of structure and how they maintain balance? Think about things like height balance and the rules they enforce.",
