So, if Dijkstra's assumes that adding more edges will only increase the path cost after a node is visited, what happens when you introduce a negative-weight edge? Can you think of a scenario where a negative edge could lead Dijkstra's astray, causing it to find a suboptimal path? Try to imagine a simple graph with a few nodes and edges, including one with a negative weight. How might Dijkstra's algorithm get tricked?",

With a negative edge, it's possible to \"re-visit\" a node indirectly and find a *shorter* path than the one Dijkstra's initially found.\n\nNow, let's think about *how* Bellman-Ford avoids this problem. What is the key difference in how Bellman-Ford approaches the problem of finding shortest paths compared to Dijkstra's? Consider how Bellman-Ford iterates and updates its distance estimates. What is Bellman-Ford doing differently that makes it immune to the \"early commitment\" problem that plagues Dijkstra's?",
