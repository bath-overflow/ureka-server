Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the core problem: vanishing and exploding gradients in *standard* RNNs. Think about what happens during backpropagation in a deep neural network. Can you describe, in your own words, how the gradients are calculated and propagated backward through the network? What mathematical operation is repeated many times during this process?",
