To really understand when a semaphore is preferred, let's break down the fundamental difference between a semaphore and a mutex.\n\nCan you tell me in your own words, what is the primary purpose of a mutex? And what is the primary purpose of a semaphore? Think about the problems each is designed to solve.",

What does that lock *do*? What does it protect, and how does it protect it? And similarly, what does that \"number attached\" to the semaphore represent? What kind of control does that number give you?\n\nThink about scenarios where you might need to control access to a resource in a more nuanced way than just a simple \"locked\" or \"unlocked\" state. What situations might call for that?",
