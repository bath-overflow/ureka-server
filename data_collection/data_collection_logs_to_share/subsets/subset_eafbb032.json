      "message": "Okay, that's a great question! It highlights a really important gap between theory and practice. You're right, regularization techniques like L2 and dropout are *designed* to prevent overfitting, and there's often theoretical justification for why they *should* work. So, the fact that they sometimes fail is definitely worth exploring.\n\nInstead of just giving you the answer, let's break this down. To help me understand your current understanding, let's start with a simple question:\n\nIn your own words, what is the core *goal* of regularization, and how do L2 and dropout each *attempt* to achieve that goal?  Think about what overfitting means in terms of the model's complexity and how these techniques try to control it.",
