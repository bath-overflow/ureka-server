To be even more precise, let's think about the \"bigger array\" part.\n\nInstead of just creating an array that's *barely* bigger, how much bigger do you think dynamic arrays typically grow by when they run out of space? Is it a fixed amount, or does the size increase in some other way? Why might that be a good strategy?",
