Before we dive into the specific scenarios, let's make sure we're on the same page.\n\nCan you tell me in your own words, what is the primary goal of both AVL trees and Red-Black trees?

Both AVL and Red-Black trees are self-balancing binary search trees designed to guarantee logarithmic time complexity for key operations.\n\nNow, let's dig a little deeper into how they achieve this balance. You mentioned rotations, which is correct. But are the balancing mechanisms *exactly* the same? Think about the degree of balance each tree strives for.\n\nIn other words, would you say that AVL trees and Red-Black trees maintain the *exact same* level of \"balanced-ness\"? Why or why not?",
