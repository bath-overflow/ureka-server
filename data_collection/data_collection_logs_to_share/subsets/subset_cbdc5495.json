More precisely, k-means works best when clusters are:\n\n1.  **Spherical (or roughly so):** K-means tries to minimize the distance between points and the centroid of their assigned cluster. This works well when clusters are shaped like balls or circles because the centroid is a good representation of the cluster's center.\n2.  **Equally sized (or at least, not drastically different):** Because k-means aims to minimize the overall within-cluster variance, it can struggle when clusters have very different numbers of points. Larger clusters tend to \"pull\" the centroids towards them.\n3.  **Well-separated:** K-means assumes that clusters are distinct and not heavily overlapping.\n\nSo, with these assumptions in mind, how do you think the *shape* of non-convex data violates these assumptions? Think about what \"non-convex\" *means* visually.",
