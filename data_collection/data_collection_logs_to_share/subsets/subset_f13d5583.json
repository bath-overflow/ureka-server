Can you briefly explain, in your own words, what overfitting is and how L2 regularization and dropout *are supposed to* help prevent it?",

      "message": "Overfitting is when a model learns the training data too well, including the noise, so it performs poorly on new, unseen data. L2 regularization adds a penalty to the loss function based on the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and a simpler model. Dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features and preventing reliance on any single neuron.",
