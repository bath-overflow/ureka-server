It's true that AUC is often used to evaluate classification models, but it can be misleading with imbalanced datasets.\n\nBefore we dive into *why* it's unreliable, let's make sure we're on the same page. Can you explain in your own words what the ROC curve and AUC actually represent? What are we plotting, and what does the AUC value tell us in general terms?",

To understand TPR and FPR, we need to think about the possible outcomes of a binary classification:\n\n*   **True Positive (TP):** The model correctly predicts the positive class.\n*   **False Positive (FP):** The model incorrectly predicts the positive class (Type I error).*   **True Negative (TN):** The model correctly predicts the negative class.\n*   **False Negative (FN):** The model incorrectly predicts the negative class (Type II error).\n\nGiven those definitions, how would you define TPR and FPR in terms of TP, FP, TN, and FN? Try to express them as fractions or ratios. This will help solidify your understanding of what the ROC curve is actually showing us.",
