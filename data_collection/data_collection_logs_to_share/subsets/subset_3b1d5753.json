      "message": "Yes, that's a good, concise definition. So, you understand that internal fragmentation is the wasted space *within* an allocated page because the process doesn't need the entire page.\n\nNow, let's think about how the page size affects this. Imagine you have a very small apartment (a small page size) versus a very large house (a large page size). Which one is more likely to have significant unused space if you only have a small amount of furniture (the process's actual memory requirement)? Why?",

Think about it this way:\n\nLet's say a process needs just 1 byte of memory.\n\n*   **Small Page Size (e.g., 4KB):** You allocate a 4KB page. How much internal fragmentation is there?\n\n*   **Large Page Size (e.g., 2MB):** You allocate a 2MB page. How much internal fragmentation is there?Which scenario has more *potential* for wasted space? And why is it \"potential\" rather than a guaranteed amount?
