It gets to the heart of understanding the nuances between these two self-balancing tree structures.\n\nBefore diving into specific scenarios, let's make sure we're on the same page about their fundamental differences. Can you briefly describe the core principle behind how AVL trees and Red-Black trees maintain their balance? What makes an AVL tree an AVL tree, and what defines a Red-Black tree?",

      "message": "Yes, that's a very good summary! You've highlighted the key distinction: AVL trees prioritize stricter balance based on height, while Red-Black trees use color properties to achieve balance, allowing for more flexibility in height differences.\n\nNow, thinking about that difference in balance, what implications do you think it has on the *operations* performed on these trees? Specifically, consider insertion and deletion. Which tree do you think might require more rotations on average during these operations, and why?",
