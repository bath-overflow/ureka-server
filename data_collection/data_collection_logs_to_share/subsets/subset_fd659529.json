I *think* a perfectly fair scheduler would ensure that every process gets an equal share of the CPU time, so no process is starved and they all make progress at roughly the same rate. Does that sound right? I'm just worried about things like priorities... would a perfectly fair scheduler ignore priorities altogether?",

      "message": "That's a very good start! You're right, the ideal of \"fairness\" often revolves around equal allocation of CPU time, preventing starvation and ensuring relatively even progress.Now, you've hit upon a critical point with the mention of priorities. If a scheduler *strictly* adheres to equal time slices, what happens to processes that are more important or time-sensitive? Should a background process compiling code get the same CPU time as a process handling user input that needs to be responsive?\n\nThink about it this way: imagine you're managing a team. Is it always \"fair\" to give every team member the exact same amount of time and resources, regardless of their role or the urgency of their tasks? Why or why not?",

      "message": "Excellent observation! You've pinpointed the core challenge: incorporating priorities inherently introduces \"unfairness\" if fairness is *strictly* defined as equal time slices.\n\nSo, let's unpack that. Is \"unfairness\" always a bad thing in this context? Think about a real-time operating system (RTOS) used in, say, a car's braking system. Should that system treat the braking process with the same \"fairness\" as the radio? Why or why not?\n\nAnd regarding the trade-off, you're right to ask about a mathematical expression. While there isn't a single, universally accepted \"fairness equation,\" the CFS scheduler uses a clever mechanism called the \"virtual runtime\" (vruntime). Can you think of how the concept of \"virtual runtime\" could be used to balance giving higher priority processes more CPU time while still trying to maintain some semblance of fairness in the long run? What might be a good way to implement that?",
