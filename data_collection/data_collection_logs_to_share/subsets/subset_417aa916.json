Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's think about what \"fairness\" might mean in the context of a scheduler. In your own words, what would a perfectly \"fair\" scheduler *look* like, ideally? What would its properties be? Don't worry about the limitations of real-world systems yet, just paint me a picture of the ideal.",
