It gets to the heart of understanding the nuances between these two self-balancing binary search trees.\n\nBefore we dive into specific scenarios, let's make sure we're on the same page about the fundamental difference that drives their performance. Can you remind me what the key difference is in how AVL trees and Red-Black trees maintain their balance? Think about what property each tree prioritizes.",
