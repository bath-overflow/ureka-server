The Master Theorem provides a \"cookbook\" solution for divide-and-conquer recurrences of the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n).\n\nNow, focusing on the *form* of the recurrence it solves, what are the key restrictions or requirements on 'a', 'b', and particularly on how the problem size *n* is reduced in the recursive calls (i.e., the 'n/b' part)? Think about what makes the comparison between f(n) and n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup> work. Why is it important that the subproblems are of size n/b? What happens if that's not the case?",

      "message": "That's a very insightful question! Yes, you're absolutely right to focus on the comparison between f(n) and n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup>.Think about what `n/b` *really* means. It represents a consistent *fractional* reduction of the problem size in each recursive call. When we have `T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)`, we're essentially saying the problem is divided into 'a' subproblems, each of which is a fraction (1/b) of the original problem size. This leads to a balanced recursion tree where the work at each level can be neatly compared.\n\nNow, what happens when we *don't* have that consistent fractional reduction? In your example, `T(n) = 2T(√n) + log n`, how is the problem size being reduced? Is it a fraction? And if not, what implications does that have for the recursion tree and the work being done at each level? Specifically, how does it affect our ability to easily characterize and compare the cost of the subproblems with the cost of the dividing/combining step, f(n)?",
