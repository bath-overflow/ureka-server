Think about how Dijkstra's works to find the shortest path. What's its fundamental assumption about the paths it's exploring?",

Can you give me a concrete example, perhaps even a small graph in your mind, where a negative edge allows you to find a shorter path to a \"visited\" node after it's already been considered?

You've clearly identified how a negative cycle can create a shorter path to a previously visited node.\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Given that Dijkstra's fails because it prematurely declares the shortest path to a node as final, how do you think Bellman-Ford avoids this pitfall? What is fundamentally different about its approach that allows it to handle negative edges correctly? Think about how Bellman-Ford iterates and what information it updates in each iteration.",
