It gets to the heart of why operating systems are often about *approximations* rather than perfect solutions.\n\nBefore we dive into why LRU and CLOCK aren't perfect, let's make sure we're on the same page. Could you briefly explain in your own words what LRU (Least Recently Used) and CLOCK page replacement algorithms try to achieve? What is the underlying principle behind their design?",
