To start, let's make sure we're on the same page.\n\nCan you briefly explain, in your own words, what \"open addressing\" and \"separate chaining\" mean in the context of hash tables? What's the fundamental difference between the two approaches to collision resolution?",

You've got the core concept down.\n\nNow, let's delve into how these differences impact performance and memory usage, especially under high load factors. Consider this:\n\nWith a high load factor, what happens to the frequency of collisions in both open addressing and separate chaining? How does this increased collision rate then affect the time it takes to insert, search for, and delete elements in each approach? Think about the steps involved in each operation when collisions are frequent.",
