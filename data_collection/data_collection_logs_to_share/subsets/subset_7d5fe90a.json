Dijkstra's algorithm greedily selects the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance from the source.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens when you have a negative-weight edge. Imagine Dijkstra's has already marked a node 'A' as having the shortest path from the source. What happens if there's a negative-weight edge from 'A' to another node 'B'?\n\nThink about it: could the negative edge *improve* the shortest path to 'B' even after Dijkstra's has settled on the shortest path to 'A'?",
