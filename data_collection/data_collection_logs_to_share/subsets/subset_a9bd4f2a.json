To understand why, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, can you remind me what the ROC curve actually *shows*? What are the axes representing, and what does the curve itself tell us?",

And you're also right that the curve illustrates the trade-off between these rates as you vary the classification threshold.\n\nNow, let's dig a little deeper. Can you explain in your own words what FPR and TPR actually *mean* in the context of a binary classification problem? Thinking about what they represent might give us a clue about why AUC might be problematic with imbalanced data.",
