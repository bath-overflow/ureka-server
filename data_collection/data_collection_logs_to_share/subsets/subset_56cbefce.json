The \"bouncer\" and \"ticket dispenser\" comparison is very helpful.\n\nSo, building on that, let's consider this: If the club owner (the operating system) only has a \"bouncer,\" what kind of control does the owner have over the *order* in which people enter the club, or how many *specific types* of people are allowed in? Could the bouncer be used to, say, prioritize VIP guests, or ensure that there's always a certain number of dancers inside? Why or why not?",
