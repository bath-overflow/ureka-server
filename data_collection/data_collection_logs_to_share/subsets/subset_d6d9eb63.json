What is it about the way Dijkstra's works that makes it potentially problematic when negative weights are introduced? Think about the core principle behind how it finds the shortest path.",

While it doesn't get stuck in a *literal* infinite loop in the code, it can get stuck in a conceptual loop regarding shortest path determination.\n\nLet's think about it this way: Dijkstra's algorithm operates on the assumption that once a node is visited and its shortest distance from the source is determined, that distance is final. Why does Dijkstra's make this assumption? What property of positive edge weights allows it to be so confident?",
