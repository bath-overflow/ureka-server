You mentioned that with open addressing, increased collisions lead to more probes to find an empty slot. What specific probing techniques do you know, and how might their performance degrade under a high load factor? Think about linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing. How does the load factor influence the *number of probes* needed on average for each of these techniques?",
