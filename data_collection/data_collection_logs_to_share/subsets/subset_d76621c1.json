It gets right to the heart of understanding the nuances between AVL and Red-Black trees.\n\nInstead of just giving you the answer, let's explore this together. To start, can you tell me what you already know about AVL trees and Red-Black trees? What are their key characteristics, in terms of structure and how they maintain balance? Think about things like height balance and the rules they enforce.",

The height difference between sibling subtrees in an AVL tree is at most 1, while Red-Black trees allow for a greater height imbalance.\n\nNow, you've posed a great question: does that stricter balancing *always* mean AVL trees are faster for searching? Think about what \"stricter balancing\" *actually* implies. What operations become more frequent when a tree is kept meticulously balanced? And how might those operations affect overall performance, especially when we're not just searching, but also inserting and deleting?",
