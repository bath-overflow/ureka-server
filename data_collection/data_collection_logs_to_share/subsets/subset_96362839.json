But a semaphore... is it more like a counter that allows a certain number of processes to access the resource concurrently, up to the semaphore's limit? So, wouldn't a semaphore be better when you need to allow multiple processes to access a resource, but still want to limit the number doing so at once?",

You've nailed the core difference: a mutex provides exclusive access, while a semaphore allows a limited number of concurrent accesses.\n\nNow, let's dig a little deeper. You said a semaphore is better when you need to allow multiple processes to access a resource concurrently, up to a limit. Can you think of a *specific* real-world scenario where limiting concurrent access, rather than enforcing exclusive access, would be beneficial? Think about resources that can handle multiple users, but not an unlimited number.",

You said a semaphore could be used to limit the number of concurrent connections to prevent overload. Why would using a semaphore be *better* than, say, simply allowing the web server to try and handle all requests until it crashes? What are the *advantages* of controlled concurrency via a semaphore in this scenario? Think about the user experience and the overall stability of the system.",
