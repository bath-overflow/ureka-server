To understand why, let's break down what happens when multiple cores try to acquire a spinlock simultaneously.\n\nFirst, what does it mean for a core to be \"spinning\" in a spinlock? What is it actively doing?",

It's constantly checking the lock's status, repeatedly executing an instruction (or a very small set of instructions) in a loop.\n\nNow, consider this: if a core is spinning, what *isn't* it doing?
