It gets to the heart of why operating systems are often about *approximations* rather than perfect solutions.\n\nBefore we dive into why LRU and CLOCK aren't perfect, let's make sure we're on the same page. Could you briefly explain in your own words what LRU (Least Recently Used) and CLOCK page replacement algorithms try to achieve? What is the underlying principle behind their design?",

      "message": "Excellent! You've nailed the core idea. LRU aims to replace the *least recently used* page, assuming that past usage is a good predictor of future usage. CLOCK, as you mentioned, uses a reference bit to approximate this.\n\nNow, let's think about why relying on past usage might not always be accurate. Can you think of any common scenarios or program behaviors where past access patterns *wouldn't* accurately predict future access patterns? Consider different types of programs or data structures.",
