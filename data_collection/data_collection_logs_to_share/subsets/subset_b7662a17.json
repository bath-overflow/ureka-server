The key difference lies in how they control access and what they represent.\n\nYou're correct that a mutex generally allows only one process (or thread) to hold it at a time. Think of it like a key to a single restroom â€“ only one person can have the key and be inside.\n\nNow, let's refine your understanding of semaphores. While it's true that a semaphore *can* allow more than one process to access a resource, what fundamentally *defines* a semaphore? What does the semaphore's value represent? Think about what happens when a process \"waits\" or \"signals\" a semaphore. How does that change its value, and what does that change *mean*?",

I'm just trying to understand how they're really different in practice.",

If it's initialized to 5, that means up to 5 processes can access the resource concurrently.\n\nNow, you've hit upon a crucial point: What happens when you initialize a semaphore to 1? You're right to question if it becomes the same as a mutex.\n\nTo really nail down the difference, let's consider *who* is allowed to release (signal) the lock. With a mutex, which process *must* release it? And with a semaphore, *who* can signal (increment) it? How does this difference in responsibility affect how they are used? Think about scenarios where this distinction would be important.",
