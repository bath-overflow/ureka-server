Think about how Dijkstra's works to find the shortest path. What's its fundamental assumption about the paths it's exploring?",

Can you give me a concrete example, perhaps even a small graph in your mind, where a negative edge allows you to find a shorter path to a \"visited\" node after it's already been considered? This will help solidify your understanding.",
