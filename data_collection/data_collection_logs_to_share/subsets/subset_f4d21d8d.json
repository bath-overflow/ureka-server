      "message": "Okay, that's a great question! It highlights a really important gap between theory and practice. You're right, regularization techniques like L2 and dropout are *designed* to prevent overfitting, and there's often theoretical justification for why they *should* work. So, the fact that they sometimes fail is definitely worth exploring.\n\nInstead of just giving you the answer, let's break this down. To help me understand your current understanding, let's start with a simple question:\n\nIn your own words, what is the core *goal* of regularization, and how do L2 and dropout each *attempt* to achieve that goal?  Think about what overfitting means in terms of the model's complexity and how these techniques try to control it.",

      "message": "So, is it accurate to say that regularization fundamentally aims to simplify the model's decision boundary and that L2 does this by penalizing large weights while dropout does it by randomly removing neurons, forcing the network to learn more robust features?",

      "message": "Yes, that's a very accurate and insightful way to put it! You've correctly identified the core goal and the different approaches of L2 and dropout.\n\nNow, let's dig a little deeper. You mentioned simplifying the decision boundary.\n\nWhy does a complex decision boundary often lead to overfitting? What characteristics of the *data* might cause a model to create an overly complex decision boundary in the first place? Think about the relationship between the model's capacity, the amount of training data, and the noise within that data.",
