It gets to the heart of why we use these algorithms in the first place.\n\nSo, let's start with the core concept: what is the *goal* of any page replacement algorithm?

Knowing the entire future sequence of page requests is, as you pointed out, essentially impossible in a practical, real-world scenario.\n\nNow, consider this: if we *did* have this perfect knowledge of the future, what specific page replacement strategy would we employ? What would be the *optimal* choice for which page to evict? Think about it in terms of minimizing page faults.",
