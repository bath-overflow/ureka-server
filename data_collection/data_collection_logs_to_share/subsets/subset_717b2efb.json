Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, to make sure we're on the same page, can you briefly explain what we mean by \"open addressing\" and \"separate chaining\" in the context of hash tables? What's the fundamental difference between the two approaches when collisions occur?",

Now, let's build on that.\n\nSince you understand the basic mechanisms, let's think about the implications under high load factors. When the hash table is nearly full (high load factor), what happens to the performance of **open addressing** as you try to insert new elements? Why does this happen? Consider the process of finding an empty slot.",

What determines how long that \"loop\" might become in open addressing as the table fills up? Think about the distribution of keys and how collisions are resolved.\n2.  What impact does this \"looping\" have on the *average* time it takes to insert or even search for elements in the table? How does that compare to the ideal O(1) performance we hope for with hash tables?",
