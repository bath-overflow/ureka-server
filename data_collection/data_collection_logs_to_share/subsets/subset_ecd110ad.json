Imagine unfolding an RNN in time. What operation is repeatedly applied to the hidden state as information flows through the network? And what might happen if that operation has certain properties? Think about how repeated multiplication affects numbers greater than 1 and numbers less than 1. How might this relate to the gradients during backpropagation?",
