It shows you're thinking critically about the Master Theorem.\n\nBefore we dive into *why* it's inapplicable to something like T(n) = 2T(√n) + log n, let's make sure we're all on the same page. Can you remind me, in your own words, what the general form of a recurrence relation needs to look like for the Master Theorem to be applicable? What are the key parameters and constraints involved?",
