You're asking about two related problems in RNNs and how LSTMs and GRUs address them.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the *exploding and vanishing gradients* part. Can you explain in your own words what a gradient is in the context of training a neural network? What role does it play?",

And you're also correct that it indicates the direction and magnitude of change needed to minimize the loss.\n\nSo, with that understanding of gradients in mind, can you think about how repeatedly multiplying values *related* to the gradient during backpropagation in a deep RNN might lead to either exploding or vanishing gradients? What mathematical operation is at the heart of this issue? Think about what happens when you multiply a number by itself many times, and how that outcome changes depending on the value of that number.",
