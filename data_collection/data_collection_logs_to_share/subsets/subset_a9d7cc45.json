    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "message": "Exactly! You're spot on. Because the partitions are so unbalanced, instead of dividing the problem size roughly in half with each step (like in the average case), you're only reducing it by one element. This means the recursion goes much deeper, specifically to a depth of O(n).\n\nAnd since you're doing O(n) work at each level (the partitioning step), the total work becomes O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2).\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to randomized pivots. How do you think *randomly* choosing the pivot helps to avoid this worst-case scenario? What does randomness bring to the table?",
