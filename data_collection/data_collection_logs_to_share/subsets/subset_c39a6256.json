You've captured the key difference: a semaphore manages access to a resource with multiple \"slots\" or permits, while a mutex is strictly binary (locked or unlocked).\n\nNow, let's build on that. You've described *what* a semaphore does, but let's dig into *why* you might choose it over a mutex.\n\nThink about scenarios where allowing multiple processes concurrent access, up to a limit, would be beneficial. Can you think of any real-world examples or programming situations where limiting concurrent access, rather than restricting it to only one, would be the better approach? Consider performance, resource utilization, and the nature of the shared resource itself.",
