Dijkstra's algorithm makes a \"greedy\" choice at each step, assuming that once a node is visited, the shortest path to that node has been found.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens when we introduce negative-weight edges. Can you imagine a scenario where a negative-weight edge could *improve* a path to a node that Dijkstra's has already marked as \"visited\" with its shortest distance?",
