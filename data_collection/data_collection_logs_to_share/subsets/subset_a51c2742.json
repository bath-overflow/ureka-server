The Master Theorem provides a \"cookbook\" solution for divide-and-conquer recurrences of the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n).\n\nNow, focusing on the *form* of the recurrence it solves, what are the key restrictions or requirements on 'a', 'b', and particularly on how the problem size *n* is reduced in the recursive calls (i.e., the 'n/b' part)? Think about what makes the comparison between f(n) and n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup> work. Why is it important that the subproblems are of size n/b? What happens if that's not the case?",
