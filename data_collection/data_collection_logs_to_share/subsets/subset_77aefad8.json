Can you remind me what internal fragmentation *is* in the context of memory management? Try to explain it in your own words. What's actually being \"fragmented\" and where is it located?",

Now, let's connect that definition to the page size.\n\nThink about it this way: if you have a fixed-size container (like a page) and you put something inside that container, what happens to the unused space if the container is very large compared to what you're putting in it? How does the size of the \"container\" (the page) influence the amount of potentially unused space *within* that container?",
