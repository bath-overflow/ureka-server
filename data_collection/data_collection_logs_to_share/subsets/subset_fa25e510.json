To start, let's break down *why* the Master Theorem is so useful in the first place.\n\nWhat kind of recurrence relations *can* the Master Theorem solve easily? What characteristics do they have? Think about the general form of a recurrence that the Master Theorem applies to: T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n). What do 'a', 'b', and f(n) represent in that equation?",
