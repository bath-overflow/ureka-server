That intuition about inefficiency is spot on!\n\nSo, let's focus on that inefficiency for a moment. Imagine a scenario where a parent process `fork()`s a child, and the child's very first action is to call `exec()` to load a completely different program.\n\nWhat would be the consequence of copying all the parent's memory space to the child *before* the `exec()` call?
