A sorted (or nearly sorted) array is a classic example of a bad input for quicksort, *especially* if you consistently choose the first or last element as the pivot.\n\nWhy does that lead to O(n^2) time? Can you walk me through the partitioning process in that scenario, and explain how the size of the subproblems changes with each recursive call?
