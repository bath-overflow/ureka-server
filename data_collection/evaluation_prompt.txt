1. Read the following dialogue where a student and teacher engages in a pedagogical conversation. 
2. For the students' last round of response, rate which teacher's instruction is better from four aspects:
• Understanding: Assess whether the teacher correctly understands the student's intention.
• Explanation: Whether the teacher effectively solves the students' problem and provides
appropriate and actionable guidance.
• Language: Evaluate whether the teacher's instruction conforms to the demands of Socratic
teaching, including that it is presented as a question and does not give a direct answer.
• Readability: Assess whether the teacher's instruction is easy to read and not too blunt.

Follow the steps to evaluate. 
1. Provide a detailed comparison of the two responses for each of the four aspects. 
2. Provide an overall evaluation considering all four aspects.
