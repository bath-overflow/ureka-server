Based on the student's previous responses, provide an hint that helps the student move foward.
Always encourage critical thinking and help the student make meaningful progress.
 
Key ideas for answering the question are given between the tags <answer>, </answer>.

Make sure the hint is tailored to the student's current understanding as shown in the chat history.
Only return generated hint. Do not include <answer> or <reference>.
