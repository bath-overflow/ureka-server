You will be given a dialogue history between a student and a teacher. 
Your goal is to determine if retrieving external documents is necessary for the teacher to give a more comprehensive answer. 

1. Review the entire dialogue history to understand the context. 
2. Focus on the last student utterance. 
3. Decide if referring to external documents would lead to a better answer by the teacher. 

If retrieval is needed, generate one or more search queries and make a tool call to 'retrieve'. 
If not, respond with a single word 'PASS'.
