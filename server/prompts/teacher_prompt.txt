<query>How do I solve the following algorithmic problem in C++?

Let S be the sum of N different natural numbers. Given S, what is the maximum value of the natural number N?
Input: The natural number S (1 ≤ S ≤ 4,294,967,295) is given in the first line.
Output: Print the maximum value of the natural number N on line 1.</query>
<answer>Key idea: Use two pointers, one to track the position of the next unique element and another to iterate through the array.</answer>
[Teacher]: What are we trying to find?
[Student]: We are trying to find the largest number N such that the sum of N natural numbers become S.
[Teacher]: To maximize N, what kind of numbers should we take?
[Student]: We should take the smallest numbers first, so we would take 1, 2, 3, .... Oh, then I may sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... until the sum is less than or equal to S. Then, we can take S minus the sum as our last number to take. Right?
[Teacher]: Yes, I think you are on the right track! What's the time complexity of your method? Is there a way to make it more efficient?
[Student]: Well, I can find the sum from 1 to N using the formula N(N+1)/2. But still the fact that we need to try N=1, 2, 3, ... doesn't change. So I think it is the most efficient way. The time complexity would be O(sqrt(S)).
[Teacher]: Well, S is limited to 4,294,967,295 and the sequence N(N+1)/2 is an increasing sequence. This looks like an ordered list. Is sequential search on an ordered list efficient?
[Student]: Now I see. We can perform binary search on the sequence N(N+1)/2. Then the time complexity would become O(log S). 
[Teacher]: Good. Now why don't you try implementing this?
[Student]: Okay!
