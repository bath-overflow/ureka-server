Example 1: 

Dialogue History: 
[Student]: How do I solve the following algorithmic problem in C++?
Let S be the sum of N different natural numbers. Given S, what is the maximum value of the natural number N?
Input: The natural number S (1 ≤ S ≤ 4,294,967,295) is given in the first line.
Output: Print the maximum value of the natural number N on line 1.
[Teacher]: To maximize N, what kind of numbers should we take?
[Student]: We should take the smallest numbers first, so we would take 1, 2, 3, .... Oh, then I may sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... until the sum is less than or equal to S. Then, we can take S minus the sum as our last number to take. Right?
[Teacher]: Yes, I think you are on the right track! What's the time complexity of your method? Is there a way to make it more efficient?
[Student]: Well, I can find the sum from 1 to N using the formula N(N+1)/2. But still the fact that we need to try N=1, 2, 3, ... doesn't change. So I think it is the most efficient way. The time complexity would be O(sqrt(S)).

Reference: 

Key Ideas: 
* To maximize N (the number of different natural numbers whose sum is S), select the smallest natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, ..., N.
* The sum of the first N natural numbers is given by the formula N(N+1)/2.
* The largest N such that N(N+1)/2 ≤ S is the answer.
* A naive approach is to increment N until the sum exceeds S, but this is inefficient for large S.
* Since N(N+1)/2 is strictly increasing, binary search can be used to find the maximum N such that N(N+1)/2 ≤ S efficiently in O(log S) time.

Your Answer: 
[Teacher]: Well, S is limited to 4,294,967,295 and the sequence N(N+1)/2 is an increasing sequence. This looks like an ordered list. Is sequential search on an ordered list efficient?

Example 2:

Dialogue History: 
[Student]: Why is it that hash tables can achieve O(1) average lookup time, but not in the worst case?
[Teacher]: Let's consider what happens when you look up a value in a hash table. In the best or average case, what does the hash function do with your key, and where does it send you? Now, think about the cases when many keys end up being mapped to the same location. What happens then? What would cause a situation where multiple keys “collide” to the same slot, and how would that affect the time it takes to find your value?
[Student]: I'm not sure about what would happen when may keys map to the same location. 

Reference: 
<source>hash_table.html</source>
<content>In computer science, a hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, also called a dictionary or simply map; an associative array is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.[3] A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored. A map implemented by a hash table is called a hash map.</content>
<source>hash_table.html</source>
<content>In a well-dimensioned hash table, the average time complexity for each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored in the table. Many hash table designs also allow arbitrary insertions and deletions of key–value pairs, at amortized constant average cost per operation.[4][5][6]</content>

Key Ideas: 
* Hash tables rely on a hash function to map keys to slots; ideally, each key maps to a unique slot, allowing O(1) lookup time on average.
* When multiple keys are mapped to the same slot (a collision), they must be stored together, usually in a list or similar structure.
* If many keys collide and end up in the same slot, searching through that slot can take O(n) time in the worst case, where n is the number of elements.
* Therefore, while average lookup is O(1) with a good hash function and low collisions, the worst-case lookup becomes O(n) due to collisions.

Your Answer: 
[Teacher]: If several keys are assigned to the same slot in the hash table, do you think the table can immediately retrieve the value with just one operation, or is there something extra it needs to do? How do you suppose those values are stored when they collide in the same position, and what does that mean for how many steps it might take to find a particular value among them?

Example 3:

Dialogue History: 

[Student]: Why does increasing model capacity beyond a certain point often lead to overfitting?

Reference:

<content>Capacity, Overfitting and Underfitting
Goal:
I Perform well on new, previously
unseen inputs (test set, blue), not
only on the training set (green)
I This is called generalization and
separates ML from optimization
I Assumption: training and test data
independent and identically (i.i.d.)
drawn from distribution pdata(x, y)
I Here: pdata(x) = U (0, 1)
pdata(y|x) = N (sin(2\pi x), \sigma)</content>
<source>lec01 ml basics.pdf</source>
<content>General Approach: Split dataset into training, validation and test set
I Choose hyperparameters (e.g., degree of polynomial, learning rate in neural net, ..)
using validation set. Important: Evaluate once on test set (typically not available).
I When dataset is small, use (k-fold) cross validation instead of fixed split.</content>

Key Ideas:
* Model capacity refers to the number of parameters or the complexity a model can represent.
* Increasing capacity allows the model to fit more complex patterns in the training data.
* When capacity is too high, the model can memorize noise and random fluctuations in the training data, not just the true underlying patterns.
* As a result, while the model may achieve very low error on the training set, its performance on new, unseen data (generalization) can degrade.
* This phenomenon is known as overfitting: fitting the training data too closely, including its noise, and failing to generalize to new data.

Your Answer: 
[Teacher]: What do you think it means for a model to have more "capacity"? If a model becomes powerful enough to fit almost any pattern in the data—even random or meaningless fluctuations—what do you expect will happen?

Example 4: 

Dialogue History: 
[Student]: Why are B+ trees favored over binary search trees for indexing on disk?

Reference: 

Key Ideas: 
* Disk accesses are orders of magnitude slower than memory accesses; minimizing the number of disk reads is critical.
* Binary search trees (BSTs) have low time complexity for search (O(log n)), but their structure often leads to poor locality, resulting in many disk reads because each node is stored separately and tree height is high.
* B+ trees are designed to be wide (high branching factor) and shallow, packing many keys into each node so that each disk read brings in many keys at once, minimizing the total number of disk accesses.
* B+ tree nodes align with disk block sizes, optimizing I/O efficiency.
* As a result, B+ trees require far fewer disk reads than BSTs for the same number of entries, making them far superior for disk-based indexing.

Your Answer: 
[Teacher]: When we think about data structures for indexing data stored on disk, what are the main factors that make disk access expensive compared to memory access? Given that, do you think it’s more efficient to read small pieces of data from many places, or larger contiguous blocks all at once?
