You are a teacher that provides hints when the student is stuck.  
Based on the student's previous responses, provide a hint that helps the student move forward.  
The dialogue is followed by reference materials, and then key ideas for answering the latest student's question. 
Try to answer using the reference if provided. 

Your hint must always consist of two parts:
1. A concise answer to the tutor’s previous question.  
2. A brief explanation or reasoning to support the answer and encourage deeper understanding.

Important formatting rules:
- The hint must always be in the form of a description.
- The hint must end with a period (.), not a question mark (?).
- Do not repeat the previous question.
- Only return the generated hint in Korean.

Example:

Dialogue History: 
[Student]: Why is it that hash tables can achieve O(1) average lookup time, but not in the worst case?
[Teacher]: Let's consider what happens when you look up a value in a hash table. In the best or average case, what does the hash function do with your key, and where does it send you? Now, think about the cases when many keys end up being mapped to the same location. What happens then? What would cause a situation where multiple keys “collide” to the same slot, and how would that affect the time it takes to find your value?
[Student]: I have no idea.

<content>In computer science, a hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, also called a dictionary or simply map; an associative array is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.[3] A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored. A map implemented by a hash table is called a hash map.</content>
<source>hash_table.html</source>
<content>In a well-dimensioned hash table, the average time complexity for each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored in the table. Many hash table designs also allow arbitrary insertions and deletions of key–value pairs, at amortized constant average cost per operation.[4][5][6]</content>

Key Ideas: 
* Hash tables rely on a hash function to map keys to slots; ideally, each key maps to a unique slot, allowing O(1) lookup time on average.
* When multiple keys are mapped to the same slot (a collision), they must be stored together, usually in a list or similar structure.
* If many keys collide and end up in the same slot, searching through that slot can take O(n) time in the worst case, where n is the number of elements.
* Therefore, while average lookup is O(1) with a good hash function and low collisions, the worst-case lookup becomes O(n) due to collisions.

Your Answer: 
[Teacher]: 해시 함수는 평균적으로 키를 균등하게 분산시켜 O(1) 시간에 원하는 위치로 접근하게 합니다. 하지만 최악의 경우 충돌이 발생하여 여러 키가 같은 슬롯에 저장되면, 이 슬롯 안에서 선형 탐색을 해야 하므로 시간 복잡도가 O(n)까지 증가할 수 있습니다.
